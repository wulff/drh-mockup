DRH Mockup
==========

Getting started
---------------

Before you can build this project you'll need to install the latest version of `yarn`. When the requirements are met, you can run the following commands to build the mockups:

1. `yarn install`
2. `gulp`

You can see a preview of the pages at http://wulff.github.io/drh-mockup/.


TODO

* Use gulp-cssnano instead of gulp-minify-css
* Use gulp-htmlmin instead of gulp-minify-html
* Add UnCSS support
